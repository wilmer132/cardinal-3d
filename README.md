# Cardinal3D: Stanford CS248A Assignments 2 and 3

We have created a [Wiki](https://stanford-cs248.github.io/Cardinal3D/) that will be the primary source of information about assignments 2 and 3. On that page you will find all the details about how to use the starter code, what you need to implement, and tips/guidelines for implementing it.

Please see the following handouts for Assignments 2 and 3:

* [MeshEdit: Assignment 2 Handout](MeshEditHandout.md)
